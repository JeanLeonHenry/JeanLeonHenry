## Hi there 👋

I'm Jean-Léon (🇫🇷 🇬🇧), an enthusiast programmer, working these days as a math teacher.

### ✔️ I worked on
- [mathalea](https://github.com/mathalea/mathalea) (TypeScript 🟦), an interactive exercise platform aimed at highschool math.
- [pynotes](https://github.com/JeanLeonHenry/pynotes) (Python 🐍), a teaching tool to generate student reports from a test marking spreasheet.

### 🌱 I'm learning
- Go 🐹 : a CLI typing test app is coming soon to this Github. I'm using the lovely [Bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/) TUI library.
