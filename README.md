## Hi there 👋

I'm Jean-Léon (🇫🇷 🇬🇧), a programming enthusiast, working these days as a math teacher.

### ✔️ I worked on
- [pynotes](https://github.com/JeanLeonHenry/pynotes) (Python 🐍) : a teacher's tool to generate student reports from a test marking spreasheet.
- [mymedia](https://github.com/JeanLeonHenry/mymedia) (Go 🐹) : a media library browser.

### 🌱 I'm working on
- learning back-end development on [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/u/runnypotential95).
- [mathalea](https://forge.apps.education.fr/coopmaths/mathalea) (TypeScript 🟦), an interactive exercise platform aimed at highschool math.



### 🔭 Projects
- I'm planning on making the aforementionned `pynotes` into a proper web app.
