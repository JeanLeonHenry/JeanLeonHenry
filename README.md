## Hi there 👋

I'm Jean-Léon (🇫🇷 🇬🇧), a programming enthusiast, working these days as a math teacher.

### ✔️ I worked on
- [mathalea](https://github.com/mathalea/mathalea) (TypeScript 🟦), an interactive exercise platform aimed at highschool math.
- [pynotes](https://github.com/JeanLeonHenry/pynotes) (Python 🐍), a teacher's tool to generate student reports from a test marking spreasheet.

### 🌱 I'm learning
- Go 🐹
    - ✔️ [I made a typing test app](https://github.com/JeanLeonHenry/typingTest). I'm using the lovely [Bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/) TUI library.
    - 🚧 I'm making a media library browser. Repo coming soon.
- Back-end development : [my profile on boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/u/runnypotential95)

### 🔭 Projects
- I'm planning on making the aforementionned `pynotes` into a proper web app.
